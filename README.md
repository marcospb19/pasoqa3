# `pasoqa3`

`pasoqa3` is an acronym for "***P***arser ***A***nd ***S***ummarizer ***O***f ***Q***u**A**ke ***3*** (log files)".

Check [`DECISIONS.md`] for an explanation of why I took some of the decisions I did.

## Installation

In Unix, with the `Rust` toolchain installed, clone the repository and install `pasoqa3` using `cargo`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marcospb19/pasoqa3
cargo install --path pasoqa3
```

You can see the binary at `~/.cargo/bin/pasoqa3`, make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is listed in your shell's `$PATH` variable to access it from anywhere.

## Usage examples

```sh
pasoqa3 example.log
pasoqa3 1.log 2.log 3.log
pasoqa3 path/to/log/file/example.log
```

## How it works

All matches of **Quake 3 Arena** have their _kill feed_ written into a log file.

A single log file might contain zero or multiple matches written to it.

`pasoqa3` reads a log file, tries parsing it, and outputs a summary of the _kill feed_ for each match.

## Trivia

The name _"pasoqa"_ is a playful reference to _"pa√ßoca"_, [a Brazilian candy] I used to love as a child.
